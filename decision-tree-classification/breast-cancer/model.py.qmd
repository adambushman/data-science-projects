# Introduction

Data sourced from Kaggle,
[Breast Cancer Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fatemehmehrparvar/breast-cancer-prediction), accessed February 19th, 2024. Downloaded extracts are saved within this repository and loaded for purpose of modeling.


# Analysis prep

```{python}

# Loading libraries
import pandas as pd
from sklearn import tree
from pandas_summary import DataFrameSummary

# Load data into session
cancer = pd.read_csv("breast-cancer-dataset.csv")

```

# Basic data exploration

```{python}

# Understand fields
cancer_summary = DataFrameSummary(cancer)
cancer_summary.summary()

```

# Clean dataset

```{python}

cancer.columns = ["Pat_Id", "Year", "Age", "Menopause", "Tumor_Size_Cm", "Inv_Nodes", "Breast", "Metastasis", "Breast_Quadrant", "History", "Diagnosis_Result"]

cancer_clean = (
    cancer
        .assign(
            Pat_Id = lambda dfa: (dfa.Pat_Id
                .astype("category")), 
            Menopause = lambda dfb: (dfb.Menopause
                .astype("bool")), 
            Tumor_Size_Cm = lambda dfc: (
                pd.to_numeric(dfc.Tumor_Size_Cm)), 
        )
)
