# Analysis prep

```{python}

# Loading libraries
import os
import pandas as pd
from sklearn import tree

```

```{python}

# Load data into session
cancer = pd.read_csv("breast-cancer-dataset.csv")

```

# Basic data exploration

```{python}

# Understand fields
cancer_summary = DataFrameSummary(cancer)
cancer_summary.summary()

```

# Clean dataset

```{python}

# Turn `class_type` to a factor

```
