# Predicting Likelihood of Default

This project

This project features analytical workflows in data wrangling, data analysis, and data science. 

A collection of individual work for the Capstone #2 (IS 6812) project, part of the Eccles Business School Masters of Science Business Analytics graduate program. To review this work in detail, see my [personal notebooks](https://adambushman.github.io/home-credit-default-risk-individual/) and [team notebooks](https://adambushman.github.io/home-credit-default-risk-group/).
