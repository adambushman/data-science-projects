# Introduction

Data sourced from R,
[{mtcars}](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/mtcars.html), accessed August 11th, 2024. Downloaded extracts are saved within this repository and loaded for purpose of modeling.

This notebook implements a linear regression technique in Julia using the {___} library.
 
# Analysis Prep

```{julia}

# Load packages
using CSV, GLM, Plots, TypedTables

# Read in the data and define as a table
data = CSV.File("../mtcars.csv")
table = Table(data)

```

# Simple Exploratory Data Analysis

# Feature Engineering

# Setup training and testing sets

```{julia}

model01 = lm(@formula(mpg ~ cyl+disp+hp+wt+gear+carb), table)

```

# Defining the model, recipe

# Setting up the workflow and tuning

# Evaluating metrics
