# Introduction

Data sourced from R,
[{mtcars}](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/mtcars.html), accessed August 11th, 2024. Downloaded extracts are saved within this repository and loaded for purpose of modeling.

This notebook implements a linear regression technique in Julia using the {GLM} library.
 
## Analysis Prep

```{julia}

# Load packages
using CSV, GLM, Plots, DataFrames, StatsBase

# Read in the data and define as a table
data = CSV.File("../mtcars.csv")

df = DataFrame(data)

```

## Simple Exploratory Data Analysis

## Feature Engineering

## Setup training and testing sets

```{julia}

function get_splits(df::DataFrame, prop::Float64)
    df_size = size(df)[1]
    train_idx = wsample([true,false], [prop, 1-prop], df_size)

    train_df = df[train_idx, :]
    test_df = df[.!train_idx, :]

    return train_df, test_df
end

```

```{julia}

training, testing = get_splits(df, 0.7)

```


## Defining the model

```{julia}

model01 = lm(@formula(mpg ~ cyl+disp+hp+wt+gear+carb), training)

```

## Making a prediction

```{julia}

pred01 = predict(model01, testing)

```

## Evaluating metrics
