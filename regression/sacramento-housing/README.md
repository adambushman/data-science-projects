# Predicting Housing Prices with Regression Models

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of multiple linear regression to predict housing prices based on various features. The goal was to explore feature selection and model evaluation techniques.

## Data Description
- **Source**: [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing)
- **Size**: 5,000 rows, 10 features
- **Target Variable**: Price

## Methods and Models
- Data cleaning and preprocessing with Python's `pandas`
- Exploratory Data Analysis using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`
- Regression modeling using `scikit-learn`'s Linear Regression and Ridge Regression

## Results
- Ridge Regression achieved an RÂ² of 0.87.
- Feature importance analysis identified `location` as the most significant predictor.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`
